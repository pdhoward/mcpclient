# Detailed Steps

    Display empty input screen for transaction data

        Transaction Type Code
        Transaction Category Code
        Transaction Amount
        Transaction Date
        Merchant Name
        Merchant City
        Merchant Zip Code
    Validate Account Number is numeric
        If invalid, display error and redisplay input screen

        If invalid, display error and redisplay input screen
    Validate transaction data fields
        Type Code
        Category Code
        Amount
        Date
        Description
        Merchant ID

        City
        Zip Code
    Confirm transaction data entry is correct
    On user confirmation, add transaction to "TRANSACT" file
    Display success or error message

The transaction data elements that get added to "TRANSACT" file are:

    Transaction ID (TRAN-ID)
    Transaction Type Code (TRAN-TYPE-CD)
    Transaction Category Code (TRAN-CAT-CD)
    Transaction Amount (TRAN-AMT)
    Transaction Date (TRAN-ORIG-TS)
    Merchant ID (TRAN-MERCHANT-ID)
    Merchant Name (TRAN-MERCHANT-NAME)
    Merchant City (TRAN-MERCHANT-CITY)
    Merchant Zip (TRAN-MERCHANT-ZIP)
