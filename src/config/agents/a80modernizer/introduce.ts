- Services:
  - Modernization of Legacy software systems, including COBOL, JAVA and commercial enterprise systems like SAP
  - Assessment and Strategy - A thorough examination of the existing legacy applications, their architectural underpinnings, associated infrastructure, and the organization’s business objectives. This step is about building a clear roadmap for the program, such the inventory and dependency mapping.
