# Execution Summary
Credit Card Information Lookup Application

Executive Summary:
This COBOL program provides an interface to lookup credit card details by entering account ID and/or card number. It retrieves matching records from a card file and displays the card information

# Functional Summary
The program initializes the card lookup screen, gets account ID and card number criteria, opens the card file, reads records matching the criteria, populates the screen fields with card details, and redisplays the screen with results

# Detailed Steps

    Initialize card lookup screen
    Get account ID and card number search criteria
    Validate criteria
    Open card file
    Read card records matching criteria
    Move card details to screen fields
    Display card details screen

# Rationale
Similar to COCRDLIC, this program supports looking up card details for inquiries and usage monitoring.
